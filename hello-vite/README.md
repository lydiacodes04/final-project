# React + Vite

* Background: This web app is created by Lydia Lockhart as the final project for the Triple Ten Software Engineering Bootcamp. Though we have learned fullstack web development, the project as it stands right now is frontend only.

* Purpose: This website is designed to help youth search for resources near them. To use, simply enter the zipcode in which you would like to find resources. The app makes a request from Career OneStop API and displays results from that database.

* API being used: https://api.careeronestop.org/v1/youthprogramfinder/{userId}?enableMetaData=true

* Features:
    ** React app created using Vite
    ** JSS Markup
    ** CSS animation of spinning wheel for loading
    ** CSS hover effects 
    ** BEM naming conventions
    ** Flexbox utilization

* Ideas for future improvements: 
Since this is a frontend only application, I would like to make the site more robust by connecting to a different API and creating a backend. To fully build out this website, I would like to connect with a more robust API such as SACRD which has resources relevant to the community I serve in San Antonio, TX. If the full backend were built out, I would allow users to sign up to create their own page of saved resources. They would be able to login, save their favorite resources to their page, and then log out.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
