Project Plan: Frontend Custom App

For my final project, I would like to create an app for teens in San Antonio to use to search for for community resources and save them to their profiles. 

Two main features:
1. When the user enters a keyword in the search bar (ie "housing" or "college advising"), the website will send a request to the [API service options below] and find all the relevant resources in the area. Then it will display the links to these orgs webpages on the page (main page). 
2. It will display all resources a user saves on a separate page--a protected route--which will be that user's own page.

Data presentation:
I am open to your suggestions; ideally I would like for data to be presented in cards AND on a map with markers.

*** This is a test. I want to see if I am now writing in the stage-1-frontend-and-api branch. ******
